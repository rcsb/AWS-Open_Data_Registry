# Get to Know a Dataset: Protein Data Bank 3D Structural Biology Data

This notebook serves as a guided tour of the Protein Data Bank 3D Structural Biology Data (https://registry.opendata.aws/pdb-3d-structural-biology-data) dataset. More usage examples, tutorials, and documentation for this dataset and others can be found at https://www.rcsb.org/help.

## Description
The "Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive" was established in 1971 as the first open-access digital data archive in biology. It is a collection of three-dimensional (3D) atomic-level structures of biological macromolecules (i.e., proteins, DNA, and RNA) and their complexes with one another and various small-molecule ligands (e.g., US FDA approved drugs, enzyme co-factors). For each PDB entry (unique identifier: 1abc or PDB_0000001abc) multiple data files contain information about the 3D atomic coordinates, sequences of biological macromolecules, information about any small molecules/ligands present in the entry, details about the structure-determination experiment, authors and publication information, experimental data, and the wwPDB validation report. Additional content stored in the archive includes documentation, summary reports, and software (among others). The PDB is a jointly-managed core archive of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank partnership [RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB, rcsb.org); Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe, pdbe.org); Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj, pdbj.org); Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB, emdb-empiar.org); and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB, bmrb.io)]. RCSB PDB serves as the wwPDB-designated Archive Keeper for the Protein Data Bank. Additional wwPDB Core Archives are as follows: Electron Microscopy Data Bank (wwPDB-designated Archive Keeper: EMDB) Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (wwPDB-designated Archive Keeper: BMRB)

- **HTTPS:** https://files.wwpdb.org
## Major directories in the PDB archive
The directory `pub/pdb` (https://files.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb) is the entry directory for the PDB archive downloads.

Some general notes:
- Entry files are date-stamped to show the date they were released
- Entries are grouped by the middle two characters of the 4-character PDB identifier. For example, entry file `pdb100d.ent` can be found in `pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/pdb/00/pdb100d.ent.gz`
- The two letter naming convention for structure holdings is retained for the directories within `/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided` and `/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/obsolete` but not for the directories within `/pub/pdb/data/structures/all`, which contain the structure holdings in undivided layout.
- PDB entries are available in PDB, mmCIF, and PDBML/XML format.
- Only UNIX compressed files are supported for coordinates, structure factors, and restraints.
